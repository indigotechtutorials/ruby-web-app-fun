# A basic ruby web app using Jetski librry

Originally this was an app using webrick for web server and I started mimicking rails patterns and it worked well I decided to create a gem called Jetksi which will be a new lightweight MVC framework for ruby I'm building

[🌊 Check out Jetski library here](https://github.com/indigotechtutorials/jetski)

This is pretty cool you can do this never knew it feels.

My organization style closely resembles something like Ruby on Rails as thats what I'm familiar with and wow I can see where this project could have started although I'm sure there was not such an awesome to use web server library like webrick back then.
